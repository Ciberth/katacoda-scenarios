# Step 1: Getting started

## Communication with Linux

At left of this page, there is something what we call a **terminal** window. This interface is a way to communicate with Linux. Let's ask the system to say hello to us by typping `echo "Hello there!"`{{execute}}


## Commands 

In the previous example we issued the **command** _echo_ followed by some text. The common way (used in developping) to refer to this text is with the noun **string**. Note the **"** at the start and end of the text. In Linux we typically start with the name of the program we want to run, followed by so called **parameters**. These parameters are often used to tell the program what to do. With the **echo** program we tell it *what to echo*. `echo "another example"`{{execute}}
